# MHE_MPC
An MPC implementation using ACADOS. 

# two point path planning problem
A reference point and a reference orientation is given for a robot. The robot is to reach the setpoint and orientation in a 2d plane y optimizing the quickest route to the destination. 

This projects takes it's inspiration from the project of  Mr. Mohamed W. Mehrez

The examples mentioned in the videos:

are replicated using Acados. A discrete model and a continuous model of a robot is implemented. This is a pet project and I wish to furhter improve and build on these.
